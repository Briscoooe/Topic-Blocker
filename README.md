# Topic-Blocker
A Google Chrome extension that allows you to enter a topic which will subsequently remove all posts related to that topic from your Facebook newsfeed before you see them. Written using AngularJS.

This project is a work in progress and will be completed soon.

## Description
This is a basic Google Chrome extension that allows users to enter topics one-by-one into a small popup window in the extension toolbar. Once entered, the extension will iterate through all the newsfeed post divs, and remove them ones that contain any of the user-entered topics.
